                    <p>Full Stack Software Engineer with an eye for design and a mind for backend. My experience as a Science teacher has enhanced my ability to adapt on the fly to meet the needs of real-time feedback. This, in addition to my love for UI/UX, has shaped who I am as coder. I enjoy learning new tech and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone to create a product that looks great and runs clean.</p>
